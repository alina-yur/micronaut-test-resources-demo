## Micronaut test resources demo

Run `./gradlew -t run` or `./gradlew test` to see a demo of test resources which will:

- checkout and build the test resources repository
- integrate with Gradle plugin for test resources demo purposes only (this plugin will eventually be part of the Micronaut Gradle plugin)
- spawn a test container for MySQL when running the app or launching tests
